# Building a 'Wifi-Seeing' Camera

## Description

In this project, I used a software defined radio (SDR) along with a directional Yagi antenna to scan a
cone in front of it and detect Wifi signals, overlaying it on top of a normal camera
image in order to give directional information of signal sources (possibly through
walls!). Overall, I controlled and manipulated both the radio and camera with DSP and arduino control of a servo motor for the antenna. With this application, I'm able to display the spatial awareness of Wifi signals.

## Hardware/Software Tools Used
### USRP Software Defined Radio 
The USRP B205 Mini-i is a SDR designed by Ettus Research which has a Frequency range: 70 MHz â€“ 6 GHz and up to 56 MHz of instantaneous Bandwidth

### GNURadio 
GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. I ran it mainly with Python 

GNURadio was installed via http://www.gcndevelopment.com/gnuradio/downloads.htm on Windows, specifically GNURadio V3.8.2.0-win64 for my project. 

Arduino is also an open-source tool for electronics projects which consists of the microcontroller and an IDE to run and upload code to the physical Arduino code

GNURadio Flowgraph

There are 2 routes you can use the flowchart

1. Muting the signal via a "Switch" (Used in this project)
By making use GT GUI Chooser with my Multiply Const block, I can change the value of the constant in the GNURadio interacing when running the script, just muting the USRP source by a flick of a switch.

2. Timed Intervals

Other ways that I attempted: 
Using a selector block and n file sinks as output (Able to get 6 separate readings in 6 bin files but limitation was the version I was using couldn't update to latest selector block with input and output index to swap between different output indices. Additionally, having n sinks to give n separate readings wouldn't be sustainable to keep adding file sink blocks in GNURadio)

Using custom python blocks to swap sinks (Swap File Sink & Custom File Sinks)
Couldn't come to fruition
